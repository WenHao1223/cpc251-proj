# Seismic Bump Prediction - CPC251 Project (Seismic 6)

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of high-energy seismic bumps in underground mining environments. It was developed as part of the CPC251 course project.

## 📊 Project Overview

Mining operations are susceptible to seismic activities, which can be hazardous. This project explores the classification of seismic bumps using various machine learning models and selects the best-performing classifier for deployment based on metrics such as recall, precision, F1-score, and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection  
4. Model Training & Evaluation
